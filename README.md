# Predicting-Probability-of-Reordering-Processed-or-Fresh-Food

In class, we learned about Bayes Theorem and how it can be used to calculate the probability of an event happening given another event. 
Additionally, we also learned about binary search trees in Graph Theory and how it efficiently searches for an element in the tree. 

Decision trees can be seen as a combination of these two ideas where the simple, yet powerful idea of searching can be used to make decisions and predict outcomes.
